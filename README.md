Environment Development: Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)

## Setup Build Environment

  -Run 'make config' to setup tools build

  -Run 'make help' for more informations

## Configuring the Project

* `idf.py set-target <chip_name>` sets the target of the project to `<chip_name>`. Run `idf.py set-target` without any arguments to see a list of supported targets.
* `idf.py menuconfig` opens a text-based configuration menu where you can configure the project.

## Compiling the Project

`idf.py build`

This will compile app, bootloader and generate a partition table based on the config.

## Flashing the Project

When the build finishes, it will print a command line to use esptool.py to flash the chip. However you can also do this automatically by running:

`idf.py -p PORT flash`

## Viewing Serial Output
`idf.py monitor`
Exit the monitor by typing Ctrl-].

To build, flash and monitor output in one pass, you can run:

`idf.py flash monitor`

## Compiling & Flashing Only the App

After the initial flash, you may just want to build and flash just your app, not the bootloader and partition table:

* `idf.py app` - build just the app.
* `idf.py app-flash` - flash just the app.

`idf.py app-flash` will automatically rebuild the app if any source files have changed.

## Erasing Flash

The `idf.py flash` target does not erase the entire flash contents. However it is sometimes useful to set the device back to a totally erased state, particularly when making partition table changes or OTA app updates. To erase the entire flash, run `idf.py erase-flash`.

This can be combined with other targets, ie `idf.py -p PORT erase-flash flash` will erase everything and then re-flash the new app, bootloader and partition table.
